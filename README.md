# Micromouse_v1

This project aims to develop a [micromouse](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=micromouse) using a DOIT ESP32 dev module. The robot is powered by two 18620 batteries in series, and two micro metal motors fitted with encoders. The mapping is done using three VL53L0X TOF sensors.

**Currently a work in progress.**
